#Chapter 3 - Distributions of Random Variables

    Practice: 3.1 (see normalPlot), 3.3, 3.17 (use qqnormsim from lab 3), 3.21, 3.37, 3.41
    Graded: 3.2 (see normalPlot), 3.4, 3.18 (use qqnormsim from lab 3), 3.22, 3.38, 3.42


##3.22
### a
This is a geometric distribution where p = .02 and k = 10. 
$$
P(Y = 10) = (1-p)^k*p = .016
$$
This is a geometric distribution where k < 100. Therefore, we'll need the CDF. 
$$
CDF = P(Y > 100) = 1-(1-p)^k = .87
$$
The expected value for the geometric function is given by 
$$ \frac{1-p}{p} = 49 \text{ when } p = .02 $$
and the deviation is
$$ ({\frac {1-p}{p^2}})^\frac{1}{2} = (\frac{98}{.004})^.5 = 49.50 $$
The expected value for the second scenario is 
$$ 
\frac{1-p}{p} = 19 \text{ when } p = .05 
$$
The standard deviation can be given by 
$$
({\frac {1-p}{p^2}})^\frac{1}{2} = (\frac{95}{.025})^.5 = 19.49
$$

As p decreases, the standard deviation and mean increase.
#3.38
The probability that there will be exactly 2 boys (when there are 3 children and males are .51 likely) is
```{r}
dbinom(2, 3, .51) #+ dbinom(3,3,.51)
```
[bbg, bgb, gbb] is the set of permutations of gender that fulfill the requirements. However, the rest are [ggg, gbg, bgg, ggb, bbb], which would give us 3/8 possibilities. Becuase 3/8 is .38, we can confirm our above findings.

The second appropach would be more tedious because we'd have to enumerate a huge number of permutations.
#3.42

P(serve) = .15, k=10, n=3. 
$$
{{10} \choose {3}}  .15^3(1-.15)^7 = .13

$$
Because the throw is independend, the 10th serve has a .15 chance of success. 

They describe different probabilities. The former describes a series of events and the latter describes only 1.
